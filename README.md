## Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: [2026-02-24]**

### 1. Information We Collect
宵崎奏 may collect and store the following data only to the extent necessary for its operations:
- **User IDs & Server IDs:** To identify server configurations and user settings.
- **Message Content:** Accessed temporarily for specific administrative features such as channel archival (`/record`) and moderation logging. 
- **Command Usage & Error Logs:** To monitor bot performance and fix technical issues.

### 2. How We Use Your Data
- **Service Fulfillment:** Message content is processed in real-time to generate HTML transcripts for backups or to log deleted/edited messages in admin-designated channels.
- **No Long-term Storage:** We do not store your message content on our private databases. Once a backup file is generated or a log is sent, the bot does not retain the message payload.
- **No Third-Party Sharing:** Your data is never sold, shared, or distributed to any third parties.

### 3. Data Retention & Your Rights
- **Data Deletion:** You have the right to request the deletion of any stored configuration data. 
- **Opt-out:** To stop data collection, you may remove the Bot from your server, which will cease all message monitoring and data processing.
- **Contact:** For any data-related inquiries, please contact the developer: zaber@zaber.online.

**By using 宵崎奏, you agree to these terms.**
